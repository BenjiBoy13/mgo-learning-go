# goto. Yes, goto

Yes, Go has a `goto` statement, it is recommended to avoid the use of it because of the confusion it may cause, but it does have some uses.

In Go, a goto statement specifies a labeled line of code and execution jumps to it. However, we canâ€™t jump anywhere. Go forbids jumps that skip over variable declarations and jumps that go into an inner or parallel block.

```go
func main() {
    a := rand.Intn(10)
    
    for a < 100 {
        if a % 5 == 0 {
            goto done
        }
    
        a = a*2 + 1
    }
    
    fmt.Println("do something when the loop completes normally")
    
    done:
        fmt.Println("do complicated stuff no matter why we left the loop")
        fmt.Println(a)
}
```
The example above may be one of the few use cases in which the `goto` statement is actually the best option, since it improves code readability.
